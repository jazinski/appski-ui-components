# AI Summary

CRITICAL FAILURE: All 5 specialized agents failed to produce valid code changes. Each agent returned identical git command error messages instead of diffs. This indicates a systemic issue with the swarm coordination infrastructure - likely the git diff extraction mechanism is broken or branches were not properly created. NO CHANGES CAN BE MERGED. The swarm system requires immediate debugging before re-execution.
